# Barbershop
### barbershop locator, appointment management/reminders, barber profiles and more

## Goal
The goal of this application is to allow barbershop owners to transition their appointments/schedule to a digital tracker making it easy for them and for the customers to see openings and book an appointment. Barbershops can also offer products or deals for recurring customers or when a customer was referred by another. It will also be possible to view a short description about relevant information about the barbers such as their availability and experience. Customers will be able to locate barbershops in their area and pick if they would like a haircut, beard line-up, or other services.
